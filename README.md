### Wthr

You must have a weather app installed on your smartphone, but how many times did you forget to bring your umbrella or wear a rain jacket or rain boots for the days when it was supposed to rain? Probably a lot. So did we. **Wthr** is aimed to change that! The app will send you a funny mms in case weather is going to drastically change and remind you to dress up appropriately.

The web app was hacked in 36 hours during HackPrinceton 2014.

##### How to run the app  
* Install all python requirements (it is advised to create virtualenv first). Run our requirements.txt file as follows:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run run.py file
```python
python run.py  
```
* Have fun!

##### Still TODO
* write function to notify existing user of weather changes
* provide ability to change cities
* learn how to put the site on external server
